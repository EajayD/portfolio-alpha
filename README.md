# portfolio-alpha

The reason this is called portfolio alpha is because this is the alpha stage of my portfolio. A super rough draft of what could possibly come in the future. For now I wanted to focus more on the functionality of the page rather than appearance. Messing around with both the HTML and the CSS to create a page that allows the user to navigate through the page while also allowing them to interact with elements within the page and taking them to different places. There are also some CSS tricks that I learned which I have applied to the page like the pseudo class of hover and transforming elements to be rotated.

## Acknowledgments

* I'd like to thank the class repositories for being available to view and reference to get ideas on certain styles and what not
* w3schools always an MVP when trying to figure out certain properties. They also had nice templates for reference which allowed me to get a vague idea of how I wanted to layout my page. Wireframing :)
