                <h3> About Me</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p> My Name is Eajay Delos Santos, currently studying web development at the UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp.
                    When I am not coding I enjoy playing video games and watching anime. I play pretty much everything from
                    FPS (First Person Shooters) to JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games). I also love talking about sports and support
                    all the Bay Area teams (49ers, SF Giants, Golden State Warriors). Win or lose, I am not a bandwagon fan that only watches when 
                    the teams are winning. Fun fact is that I used to be a professional dancer! I danced hip hop in my earlier years, but have been
                    out of it for so long, that if you asked me to perform something it would not look pretty.
